It's hard being this good
Yeah
Uh
Yeah

I took a stand in the 90's
Shook but heard turnin it
The fact that Shaq could leave a cold track burnin
Even though in the Tahoe
My whole crew could follow
I convoy 100 000 dollar car follow
Keep your eyes on the biggest big man in the era
Represent rap for all
Enrico Gates bring the terror
T W I s to the M The World Is Mine
I'm gonna shout till a thousand 99
I'm dope for breakin backboards easy
Even caught bills slippin
Like they greasy
Pockets stay cheesy
Believe me
I can stack your chips on the remix
And you still couldn't see me
Now pay me
Run to the border
Hit the water
Cause your style and your profile is out of order
I flow like a river
None come bigger
It's a fact big Shaq is just one bad

I like playin on the west side
Even though I miss playin on the east side
My girl Michelle still got my back and its alright
We could do it from the night until the daylight
**I got suckers from my past tryin to feel me
And all the ones gettin fresh tryin to kill me
A force goes through her body that could chill me**
There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me

We can cut through the red tape
And bust through the fakers
Keep your eye on big Shaq
And put your money on the Lakers
I'm guaranteed
(You'll do what?)
I repeat i'm guaranteed
To bring it to your face indeed
Type of brother who can stay up all night and hit 40
After the game get naughty
And pull your shorty
And its hard to the next stage to bring it to your idol
Bring it to your whole team and bring home the title
Let my crew known for how we do when we travel
Let's straddle leavin folks grounded like gravel
Saddle up your horse and hit the course
It's your turn
You could stay in my face and watch your whole crew burn
Now some say I
Don't shine I
Know a different story, never lie
Come watch me fly the sky's no limit
And Shaq's no gimmick you can mimmick
But you front and your finished

I like playin on the west side
Even though I miss playin on the east side
My girl Michelle still got my back and its alright
We could do it from the night until the daylight
**I got suckers from my past tryin to feel me
And all the ones gettin fresh tryin to kill me
A force goes through her body that chill me**
There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me

Now peace to the playa haters that hate me playin
Knock what I do knock what i'm sayin
I'm pullin out the red carpet and your inside it
Bring it to the front and light it and get excited
Trauma my good fellow mellow like a cello
Enrico Gonzalez one rich fellow
And watch me make your girl jiggle like jell-o
Whose world is this?
Over here baby hello

I like playin on the west side
Even though I miss playin on the east side
My girl Michelle still got my back and its alright
We could do it from the night until the daylight
I got suckers from my past tryin to feel me
And all the ones gettin fresh tryin to kill me
A force goes through her body that could chill me**
There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me

I like playin on the west side
Even though I miss playin on the east side
My girl Michelle still got my back and its alright
We could do it from the night until the daylight
I got suckers from my past tryin to feel me
And all the ones gettin fresh tryin to kill me
A force goes through her body that could chill me**
There's nothing left for you to do but try to feel me

Rock on baby
Rock on baby
Oh yeah
Rock on and on
Oh yeah
I love Superman
I love Superman
I love Superman
I love Superman
I love the Westside, it's time to party
Whenever Superman is in the house
I love the Eastside, it's time to party
Whenever Superman is in the house
"They call me Superman..."
"They call me Superman..." "Big Shaq where you at?"
"They call me Superman..." "Big Shaq where you at?"
You can't stop it or block it when I drop it
Anytime I go rhyme for rhyme on a topic
Ain't even fit to step in Shaq's arena
I look inside your mind and I seen your shook demeanor
in your eyes, why are you suprised
No matter how you try, not fly as ?ellequad?
The new edition, is this the end of your last night?
in the daytime, you couldn't see me with a flashlight
I crash flights on sights of my enemies
I'm comin through and then I bomb your whole vicinity
Why the act of fakin jacks, you're not a friend of me
I peeped your card, you're not as hard as you pretend to be
Who wanna spark it with the chocolate
Macadamia, hair clean to the cranium
You know the name, Shaq aim to maintain
Money on the brain, can't stop the reign
"Big Shaq where you at?"
What? Uhh, what?
Uhh, uhh, what? Uhh
Ninety-seven ?caddi lawn?
What, what, uhh
I creep deep with killers without million dollar figures
Blessing *niggaz* in Ac Legends and vigors
Cream lizards, cream coogi's, I do my duty
As long as they fly as me, get high as me
Success in my circle, try to break it, I hurt you
Ain't no gettin out that, I doubt that
We want thee exotic, erotic ladies
Not them toxic ladies that burn a lot
I learned a lot, from junkies to ruffians
From bein tied up by Columbians, cause 80 grams was missin
Listen, had to change my position
From wantin to be large to head *nigga* in charge
My garage, call it celo -- fours, fives, and sixes
Honies by the mixes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it
Smoked out with Leo, Biggie Tarantino
Size like a sumo, Frank White numero uno
"Big Shaq where ya at?"
7-0, ha, towerin inferno
Invincible, smooth individual
Who wanna test it, foreign or domestic
No matter where you from, I'm not the one you wanna mess wit
Origin-al Willie style, livin lavish
Private jets to let my shorty shop in Paris
I'm not the average, I'm far from the norm
Daddy long hittin em strong, keepin you warm
A lime to a lemon, my CeCe women
bringin in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in em
Vehicles with televisions in em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them, hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in
Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
Desert ease street sweeper inside the beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil
WHAT!!
I'm sending rappers to heaven
so call me uplifting
I greet ya defeat ya
take all your recognition
be in the ignition first gear
I'm gone
had the best to the worst confess my lyrics is strong

I was born to raise hell and cause havoc when I enter
have the pin back hands up white flag surrender
what I'm into pulling stocks and bonds and cheddar
gauaranteeing the world you can't find nuthin better
so whatever
bring it the front and put your money by your mouth
find your teeth and cash coming out
I bring drama to your momma if she want it
you think I'm fronitin' a fruad
Peter tell 'em how I want it

aiyo Shaq the world is yours
but can I get a city
gritty blocks shitty cops
broads with tingo bittys
hit 50 in the ruckus mutha
is I happy
you callin me fraud but your broad's calling me daddy
while you pumpin dollar bottles on the floor looking funny
I'm going drop hits with Shaq kid
and dirt getting money
sunney days is made the pain it rains no more
the cash will last from now the guns hits the floor

check it
Enrico dope like perscriptions from pharmacys
injecting through speakers with no limit slash no mercy
the ill beat seaker
I mystify minds like I'm a preacher
when I meet ya start convulsing like a seizure
you best beleive I got more tricks up my shirt sleeve
expidisouly I get loose like hair weave
which mc out there wanna come test me
put footprints in your chest like Kareem did me
I run rhymes like drunk drivers on stop signs
I change my name to Deon cause I'm mutha freaking prime time

out the alleys of the ghetto there echos a voice sweeter
the melon a felon under the first name Peter
looking out the hour glass what do I see
Guliani with tacky at me with death penalty
I dodge the cops bob and weave to the left
young gifted and black but yet I'm still marked for death
my breath and oxygen is limited
they did me in with it
they took my lungs my heart they kept my brain and headed with it
I live alive to see my seed breath airs
in and exhale but please breath clean air
runnin 'round killin people with sex you flex
spread in the bed ask me dread who's next

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
here we go again
Team Twism

mansions, villas and yacths, and friends won't do
I see you not amazed by my wealth and it's cool

very lyrical (very lyrical)
my style is tounge slashing
as well as brain smashing
like in your (shhh) kid, without asking
critics be jealous, they absent minded of course
first MC ever to have mics and shoes in the Source
but of course, I ride that white horse
I'm unbeliavble like Biggie

puttin' this down for my fam in the future
into my center, pull out size duece duece boots

so cock the pist', forty first side be lifted
